        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Reflecting on my personal development and career goals, so far I am really happy, grateful, empowered, and encouraged on how much progress I made in the past on attaining my goals before transferring to University of California, Riverside (UCR). After transferring to UCR from the community college I went to and while taking HASS 001 with Professor Stewert, my career goals as of typing this paper are either join the U.S. military and work until I satisfy the full retirement benefits, work in a private industry, like a consulting firm, or work in a non-profit organization. I am also interested in doing my own research where I want to explore my interests and to gain knowledge in the future. My career goals are related to my academic goals of obtaining a major in psychology and a minor in sociology for my undergraduate studies while for my graduate studies is obtaining a social based emphasis degree in psychology.<br><br>

          Reflecting on my areas strengths they are commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), working with other people of different backgrounds, helping to lead a group, providing tips and helping others in a group assignment or project, learning from others how completing a task, and being creative on developing new ideas. I think by committing to these strengths in general, they could all help me in building my social and relationship skills when I am working with other people, like in a group project. I also think that these skills could help develop a community with other people with a common interest and/or values to develop a sense of connection and camaraderieship. Lastly, through building a skill of connecting with other people in a social network means I am able to exchange and to learn new ideas, new perspectives, and new viewpoints from other people with no judgment and being understanding.
          <br><br>

          Although I have many of these strengths, I still wanted to focus on improving myself. Some of the key things I want to work on are becoming a leader for a group or creating a group, learning to develop self-care skills, being understanding and helpful to others, being more concise in communication, being better and more organized in planning an event or social gathering, and to satisfied on what I enjoy doing most! By focusing on these skills for self-improvement, I think I would improve my skills better in the future by being mindful of the progress I make. I also want to be more grateful and to be more proud of the progress I make in the future to know that I can do anything when facing challenges on who I am and my skills. Lastly, I want to better take care of myself through understanding my skills arenâ€™t strongly perfect but they are excellent and I am worth it.
          I am happy with these strengths but I also have some weaknesses too that I want to work on from my strengths. One of them is learning from other people as a model or as a mentor of self-development. However, an area I think needs little to no improvement is my value in DEI by joining the UCR well student organizations, studying abroad, or teaching an r course to interact with different types of people of all backgrounds.
          After reflecting on my personal goals and my career goals, through taking the steps to accomplish them, I am taking the time to reflect on my skills, my strengths and my weaknesses, and learning to develop as a better person in the future and beyond!
